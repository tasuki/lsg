The Polish Summer Go School hosts many [go/non-go/go-adjacent tournaments](https://lsg-go-art-pl.translate.goog/turnieje?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en). We have daily group lessons for dan players, kyu players, beginners, and children. These are usually held in Polish, but especially the dan-level group isn't afraid to switch to English!

The venue is a farm remodelled to a camping, inspired by the "Northern Exposure" TV series. There's a beautiful lake to swim in, forests to stroll in, horses to ride, and beers to drink. You can sleep in a cottage or in your tent. The camp provides a kitchen, a big barn rebuilt to a general meeting place and dancing room, clean toilets, showers, audio and karaoke hardware, parking. You can [see some photos on facebook](https://facebook.com/pg/przystanek.alaska.5/photos/).

## First time?

1. Register early. Places in the cottages are limited (bring a sleeping bag!). If you bring a tent you'll always fit.
2. Take warm clothes. It can get very cold.
3. After arriving, visit the shop on the left hand side of the main square or ask people sitting under the big tree for help.
